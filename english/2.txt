2 Introduction on LoRaWAN options

LoRa is a wireless modulation for long-range low-power low-data-rate applications developed by Semtech. Devices implementing more than Class A are generally named “higher Class end-devices” in this document.


2.1 LoRaWAN Classes
A LoRa network distinguishes between a basic LoRaWAN (named Class A) and optional features (Class B, Class C):

Bi-directional end-devices (Class A): End-devices of Class A allow for bi-directional communications whereby each end-device’s uplink transmission is followed by two short downlink receive windows. The transmission slot scheduled by the end-device is based on its own communication needs with a small variation based on a random time basis (ALOHA-type of protocol). This Class A operation is the lowest power end-device system for applications that only require downlink communication from the server shortly after the end-device has sent an uplink transmission. Downlink communications from the server at any other time will have to wait until the next scheduled uplink.

Bi-directional end-devices with scheduled receive slots (Class B): End-devices of Class B allow for more receive slots. In addition to the Class A random receive windows, Class B devices open extra receive windows at scheduled times. In order for the End-device to open its receive window at the scheduled time, it receives a time synchronized Beacon from the gateway.

Bi-directional end-devices with maximal receive slots (Class C): End-devices of Class C have nearly continuously open receive windows, only closed when transmitting. Class C end-device will use more power to operate than Class A or Class B but they offer the lowest latency for server to end-device communication.
