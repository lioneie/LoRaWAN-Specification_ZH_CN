This section describes the LoRaWAN Class B layer which is optimized for battery-powered end-devices that may be either mobile or mounted at a fixed location.

End-devices should implement Class B operation when there is a requirement to open receive windows at fixed time intervals for the purpose of enabling server initiated downlink messages.

LoRaWAN Class B option adds a synchronized reception window on the end-device.

One of the limitations of LoRaWAN Class A is the Aloha method of sending data from the end-device; it does not allow for a known reaction time when the customer application or the server wants to address the end-device. The purpose of Class B is to have an end-device available for reception at a predictable time, in addition to the reception windows that follows the random uplink transmission from the end-device of Class A. Class B is achieved by having the gateway sending a beacon on a regular basis to synchronize all end-devices in the network so that the end-device can open a short additional reception window (called “ping slot”) at a predictable time during a periodic time slot.

Note: The decision to switch from Class A to Class B comes from the application layer of the end-device. If this class A to Class B switch needs to be controlled from the network side, the customer application must use one of the end-device’s Class A uplinks to send back a downlink to the application layer, and it needs the application layer on the end-device to recognize this request – this process is not managed at the LoRaWAN level.
